# hidden-rice

The project scope is to create scripts that obfuscate Chow's white-box implementation.

Pre-requisites:
* gcc
* tigress

Building with debug symbols:
```
./build-variants.sh
```

If you want to omit debug symbols for the binary, add the `--no-symbols` argument when running the build script.
